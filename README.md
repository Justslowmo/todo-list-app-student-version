This app is used to create to-do lists. You can write a location and then write what you need from that location; for example, you can write "groceries" in the box that says title, and then write "get egg's" in the box that says description amd then click add task. You can continue to do this as many times as you want to keep track of things. This can be very useful in every day life and can even be used for other things than grocery lists, this can especially be useful for people with bad memories and people who gets off track easliy.
